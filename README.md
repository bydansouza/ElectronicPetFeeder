# About this! 
Electronic Pet Feeder Project - Automatic Feeder for Dogs and Cats ;)

By Daniel Henrique Camargo de Souza @ PIN22107 - IFSC/Electronic Engineering/Professors: Daniel Lohmann AND Robinson Pizzio - Dezembro/2018

# Descript:
* This project consists of an electronic automatic feeder for dogs and cats, and this project were made from course Integrator Project class in undergraduate at Electronic Engineering by IFSC/Florian√≥polis@Brazil.

# Guide to using this repository folders and files
Here you find this structure of folders and files

* `CODE` contains the main code, the Makefile and includes for compile code to microcontroller ESP8266. 

* `ELECTRONIC_DESIGN` contains the files for electronic scheme and PCB design of the circuit for the control system.

* `MECHANICAL_DESIGN` contain the files of mechanical part, essentially the helicoid part design, other parts were made from commercials items.

* `_guides` contain files for learning about sensor and controllers used in this project, essentially datasheets and manuals

* `_models` contain files for other electronic pet feeder, but this was made with Arduino (sic) 

* `_patents` contain files of patents discovered about electronic pet feeders.

* `_refs` Others references files

    All configs via MQTT
    
    Notification for user 
    
    Water control, Temperature and level

# Mechanical Project

this project is a prototype, then we use PVC commercial tubes of the 100mm to make mechanical part. however, for helicoidal transport of feed, we maked (via freecad) a design of the helicoid and built it via 3D printer. this part design you can see in folder `MECHANICAL_DESIGN`
    
we inspired from [Helidoid Model](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:27854)

# Electronic Project

Let's go to the part that interest us. For the control system, we use a microcontroller ESP8266 because it contain various periferics integrated, example is Wi-Fi Module.

## Main Code

* this code is based in esp-open-rtos sdk to ESP8266, then recommended to use the [esp-open-rtos](https://github.com/SuperHouse/esp-open-rtos)
